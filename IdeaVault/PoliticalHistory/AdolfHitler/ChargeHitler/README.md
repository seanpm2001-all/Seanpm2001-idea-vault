Hitler charge

A research project to create a list of criminal charges Hitler would receive across all countries (except Nazi Germany) in the scenario where the death penalty is used on no-one, and he got to live through his million+ year sentence

US:

UK:

EU:

AUSTRALIA:

Canada:

Mexico:

Tanzania:

Saudi Arabia:

etc.

I thought of this idea at random. With enough research, I feel that at least 10 million charges can be placed, and it can show how much of a criminal he was in a light that more people will get (for the people who think of laws instead of the genocide, murders, coup detan etc.) and also for people who just want to see how bad he really was in a different light.
